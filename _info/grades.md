<h2>A Word on Figuring Out the Class Grades Spreadsheet</h2>

The grades are shown under a <b><i>modified</i></b> perm ID number. The modified number is your perm ID number <b>modulo</b> 98773.


In other words, take your perm ID number, divide it by 98773, and the remainder is the modified number.
