c.(3 pts) Can the main program use the BankAccount member function called fraction()? Explain why or why not?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

6.(14 pts) Write a program that has a definition for a structure type called UnderGradStudents. This structure should contain student ID numbers, first and last names, major (i.e. CS, EE, ME, etc...), and GPA scores for each year (i.e. one for Freshman year, one for Sophomore, etc...). 
The program should declare and then *initialize* an array of 3 objects of this class (hint: you can do this with the same approach you define/initialize an array of any other type). 
The initial values are shown in the table below. The program should then print out some of the values of the array of objects as shown in the sample below, along with each student's AVERAGE GPA score (which you should calculate, with a precision of 2 decimal places).

TABLE:
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
|ID | First name| Last Name| Major | GPA Yr1|  GPA Yr2| GPA Yr3| GPA Yr4
|1 | Joe | Shmoe | EE | 3.8 | 3.3 | 3.4 | 3.9
|2 | Macy | Chen | CS | 3.9 | 3.9 | 4.0 | 4.0
|3 | Patrick | Sadface | ME | 3.8 | 3.0 | 2.4 | 1.9

OUTPUT:
```
These are the student records:
ID# 1, Shmoe, Joe, Major: EE, Average GPA: 3.60
ID# 2, Chen, Macy, Major: CS, Average GPA: 3.95
ID# 3, Sadface, Patrick, Major: ME, Average GPA: 2.77
```
