<h1>CS16: Programming Assignment 04</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The assignment for this week will utilize concepts of control flow that we covered in class. You may utilize other concepts of programming as well, as you see fit.

This assignment is due on Friday, October 14th at 12:00 pm.

<h2>Step 1: Getting Ready</h2>
Open a terminal window and log into the correct machine.
Change into your CS 16 directory, create a lab04 directory and change into it.
Remember that at any time, you can check what directory you are currently in with the command <b>pwd</b>.

<h2>Step 2: Create and Edit Your C++ Files</h2>
This week, you will need to create <b>xxx files called xxx.cpp, xxx.cpp, and xxx.cpp</b>:
Each corresponds to one of the problems listed below, which make up this lab.

This assignment consists of 3 problems, each of which is described below. The first one is worth 20 points each, and the last two are worth 40 points each. Each should be solved in its own file and all three must be submitted for full assignment credit. These exercises are inspied by ones from the textbook (in Ch. 3 & 4) - but they are NOT the same, so follow the instructions on THIS sheet carefully. 

<h3>XXX.CPP</h3>
Write a program that xxx

A session should look <b><i>exactly</i></b> like the following example (including whitespace and formatting - although note that there is no whitespace at the end of each of these lines), with all manners of different numbers for inputs and the output:

<img src="xxx.png" width="700" alt="program example" />

Each string printed by the program should include a newline at the end, but no other trailing whitespace (i.e. extra space characters at the end of the line).

<h2>Step 3: Create a makefile and Compile the Codes with the make Command</h2>

xxxxx makefile xxxxx

To compile our codes, we first create a makefile and put in the usual g++ commands. 

xxxxxxx MAKEFILE INSTRUCTIONS HERE xxxxxxxxx

`$ g++ -std=c++11 -o xxx xxx.cpp`

`$ g++ -std=c++11 -o xxx xxx.cpp`

`$ g++ -std=c++11 -o xxx xxx.cpp`

If the compilation is successful, you will not  see any output from the compiler. You can then use the following commands to run your programs:

`$ ./xxx`

`$ ./xxx`

`$ ./xxx`

<b>If you encounter an error, use the compiler hints and examine the line in question. If the compiler messsage is not sufficient to identify the error, you can search online to see when the error occurs in general.</b>

Remember to re-compile the relevant files after you make any changes to the C++ code.

<h2>Step 4: Submit</h2>

Once you are satisfied that your programs are correct, it is time to submit them. Login at [https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu](https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu), then navigate to “CS16_f16” and click on “lab04”. Then click “Make Submission”, and make your submission the same way as last week. Remember to submit all three .cpp files.

Please remember that you must submit the programs to obtain any credit for the assignment; just completing the programs is not enough.

Once you submit, you should see a page detailing your submission. The system will automatically grade your program and will show you the results on this page after a 1 minute delay.

You can alternatively submit your code from the command line (terminal) on any CS machine, including the Phelps lab machines or the CSIL server. You can use this method when logged in remotely. To submit the the three source files to this assignment by running the command:

`$ ~submit/submit -p xxx xxx.cpp xxx.cpp xxx.cpp`

You can copy the URL shown in the output of the above and paste into a web browser to reach the submission result page.

<h2>Step 5: Check Submission Results</h2>

After the 1 minute delay, the submit system will show your score and give you feedback on your submission. Refresh the webpage after a minute to see this information.

You may submit this lab multiple times. You should submit only after local compilation does not produce any errors and runs as expected. The score of the last submission uploaded before the deadline will be used as your assignment grade.

<h2>Step 6: Done!</h2>

Once your submission receives a score of 100/100, you are done with this assignment.

If you are in the Phelps lab or in CSIL, make sure to log out of the machine before you leave. Also, make sure to close all open programs before you log out. Some programs will not work next time if they are not closed. Remember to save all your open files before you close your text editor.

If you are logged in remotely, you can log out using the exit command:

`$ exit`
